    <p><!--my bio-->
      Product designer turned UX aficionado with a great design eye. I am currently on the hunt for freelance and/or long-term opportunities.
      <br><br>
      Curiosity and a desire to solve problems guide everything that I do in the user experience realm. I’m passionate about finding solutions that are beautiful, innovative, and keep the end user smiling. I like to be involved at different stages of the design process, from a project’s inception through to research, sketches, design, all the way to product launch.
      <br><br>
      Prior to my career switch to UX, I worked in product design and development -- most notably developing accessories for ASICS America Corporation. My previous roles have always involved bringing exceptional product to users, so it's no surprise that I'm now applying this experience to digital interfaces.
      <br><br>
      When I’m not in design mode, you can find me exploring foreign countries, scaling rock faces, or eating sushi at happy hour.
